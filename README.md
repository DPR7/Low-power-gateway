# Low-power-gateway
Low power gateway for Adafruit's IO

This is a gateway routine for the LP nodes that I'm going to make.. See https://github.com/DPR7/low_power_sensor/wiki/Wiki

The routine that i wrote to receive RF signals ( 433 mhz ) on a NodeMCU and directly transfer them to ADA fruit's IO was not stable and 
reliable. So i had to try something else. I'm now testing a setup with a Arduino pro micro and Raspberry PI with Node-red.
The idea for this setup came from Nathan Chantrell and K-Jay ( Pimatic verhaal )
